>  **Note:** The original IIS 8.0 Express
> installation with Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 can get corrupted when
> you image your machine and recreate the machine with a new user. IIS
> Express depends on configuration files that are located in the
> Documents folder of the user. When the machine is imaged, the old user
> account is lost and a new user account is created when you create a
> new VM from the image. Repairing the installation will create the
> configuration files for your new user.
