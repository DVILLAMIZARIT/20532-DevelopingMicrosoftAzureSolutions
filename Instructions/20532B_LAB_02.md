Module 2: Establishing a Development Environment using Azure Virtual
Machines

Lab: Creating an Azure Virtual Machine for Development and Testing
------------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

Before you begin the process of migrating your application from an on
premise server to Azure, you must create a development environment. You
have elected to use Azure to host a Windows Server 2012 Virtual Machine.
In this Virtual Machine, you will install project files, Visual Studio
2013 Update 4, Azure SDK for .NET 2.4 and Azure PowerShell. Once
complete, you will use this virtual machine for all remaining
development tasks.

Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

Create an affinity group in your Azure subscription.

Create a virtual network.

Create a Storage instance.

Create a virtual machine.

Manage the virtual machine VHDs.

Install development software on a virtual machine.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

For this lab, you will use the available host machine. Before you begin
this lab, you must complete the following steps:

1.  Verify that you received the credentials from your training provider
    to sign in to the Azure portal. You will use these credentials and
    the Azure account throughout the labs in this course.

### Exercise 1: Creating a Network and Resource Container

Scenario

You want to create a virtual network that you can use for your new
virtual machine. As part of creating the virtual network, you will also
create a resource group.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1\. Sign in to the Preview Portal.

2\. Create a virtual network and a resource group.

####   Task 1: Sign in to the Preview Portal {#task-1-sign-in-to-the-preview-portal .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Sign in to the Preview Portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

2.  Click **Get Started**.

####   Task 2: Create a virtual network and a resource group {#task-2-create-a-virtual-network-and-a-resource-group .ProcedureHeading}

1.  View the list of virtual networks for your subscription.

Create a virtual network by using the following details:

-   Name: **Dev20532**

-   Location: **Select the region that is closest to your location**

-   New Resource Group: **Dev20532**

-   Address Space CIDR block: **10.0.0.0/16**

-   Subnet CIDR block: **10.0.0.0/24**

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have a new virtual
network and resource group in Azure.

### Exercise 2: Creating a Development Virtual Machine

Scenario

You need a new storage account that you will use while creating your
virtual machine.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1\. Create a storage account.

2\. Create a virtual machine.

####   Task 1: Create a storage account {#task-1-create-a-storage-account .ProcedureHeading}

1.  View the list of Storage instances for your subscription.

Create a Storage instance by using the following details:

-   Name: **stor20532[Your Name Here]**

-   Location: **Select the region that is closest to your location**

Pricing Tier (Replication): **Locally Redundant (L LRS)**

####   Task 2: Create a virtual machine {#task-2-create-a-virtual-machine .ProcedureHeading}

1.  View the list of virtual machines for your subscription.

Create a virtual machine by using the following details:

> Host Name: **vm20532[Your Name Here]**
>
> User Name: **Student**
>
> Password: **AzurePa\$\$w0rd**
>
> Pricing Tier: **A3 Standard**
>
> Virtual Network: **Dev20532**
>
> Resource Group: **Dev20532**
>
> Storage Account: **stor20532[Your Name Here]**

Add a second disk to the virtual machine by using the following
settings:

> Disk File Name: **vm20532-AllFiles.vhd**
>
> Size (GB): **6**
>
> Storage Account: **stor20532[Your Name Here]**
>
> Storage Container: **vhds**

Connect to the newly created virtual machine by using Remote Desktop.

**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will have a new virtual
machine stored in a new storage account.

### Exercise 3: Configuring the Virtual Machine for Development

Scenario

Now that you have a new virtual machine, you decided to install
Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 4, Azure PowerShell, and
the Azure software development kit (SDK) for .NET 2.5.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1\. Create an AllFiles drive.

2\. Install Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 4.

3\. Install Azure SDK for .NET 2.5.

4\. Install Azure PowerShell Module.

####   Task 1: Create an AllFiles drive {#task-1-create-an-allfiles-drive .ProcedureHeading}

1.  If Server Manager is not already open, open **Server Manager**.

Disable **Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration**.

Initialize the new disk by using the Windows Disk Manager.

Format the new empty drive partition by using the following settings:

-   Drive Letter: **F**

-   Volume Label: **AllFiles**

-   Partition Style: **MBR (Master Boot Record)**

Download the **20532B: Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions -**
**AllFiles** compressed folder from the Companion MOC website
([***http://www.microsoft.com/learning/companionmoc***](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/companionmoc)).

Run the AllFiles executable to extract the content to the drive F.

Extract target: **Allfiles** **(F):\\**

####   Task 2: Install Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate Update 4 {#task-2-install-visual-studio-2013-ultimate-update-4 .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Download and run the Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate installation file
    from **http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525334**.

Install the trail version of **Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate** by
selecting only the following optional features:

-   **Microsoft Office Developer Tools**

-   **Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools**

-   **Microsoft Web Developer Tools**

Reconnect to the previously created virtual machine.

Start **Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate**.

Close **Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate**.

####   Task 3: Install Azure SDK for .NET 2.5 {#task-3-install-azure-sdk-for-.net-2.5 .ProcedureHeading}

1.  Download and run the **Azure SDK for .NET 2.5** launcher for Web
    Platform Installer from
    **http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525337**.

In Web Platform Installer, install the **Windows Azure SDK for .NET (VS
2013) – 2.5** package.

Open **Visual Studio 2013**.

Open the **Azure** node in the **Server Explorer** pane.

Import your Azure subscription.

####   Task 4: Install Azure PowerShell Module {#task-4-install-azure-powershell-module .ProcedureHeading}
