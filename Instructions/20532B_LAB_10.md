Module 10: Managing
Infrastructure in Azure

Lab: Managing Multiple Virtual Machines in a Virtual Network
------------------------------------------------------------

Scenario

To best replicate your existing production systems, you decided to
create a virtual network and host another virtual machine in the virtual
network. The new virtual machine will contain a SQL database that you
will use for your test application. You will host the test application
in an Azure Website in the same virtual network.

Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

Create a new Website.

Create a virtual machine by using a standard image.

Lab Setup

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

Before starting this lab, you must complete the lab in Module 2. For the
lab in this module, you will use the available host machine. Also, you
must complete the following steps:

On the host computer, click **Start**, type **Remote**, and then click
**Remote Desktop Connection**.

In Remote Desktop Connection, provide the name of your virtual machine
in the **Computer** box by using the following format:

**vm20532[*Your Name Here*].cloudapp.net:[*Your VM RDP Port*]**

>  **Note:** The name and port for your virtual
> machine might be saved in the Computer drop-down list. If this is the
> case, use this value instead of typing it in manually. If you are
> unsure about your virtual machine’s RDP port, use either of the Azure
> portals to find your virtual machine’s endpoints. The endpoint with
> the name **Remote Desktop** is the correct port for RDP. This port is
> randomized to protect your virtual machine from unauthorized access.

In Remote Desktop Connection, click **Connect**. Wait until the RDP
client accesses the virtual machine.

If necessary, sign in by using the following credentials:

> User name: **Student**
>
> Password: **AzurePa\$\$w0rd**

Verify that you received the credentials to sign in to the Azure portal
from your training provider. You will use these credentials and the
Azure account throughout the labs in this course.
